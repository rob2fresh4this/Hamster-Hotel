## Site Review Feedback

Your site looks good in desktop form, but here are a few areas that need attention:

### Issues

- **Font**: [checked] The font used is not accurate. Click on the text in the prototype, check the *Styles* on the sidebar to find the correct font.

- **Responsiveness**:
  - **Mobile**:
    - [checked] The images in your cards are off-center.
    - [Sticking with it] The navbar layout looks odd.
    - [checked?] The *Reservations* section responsiveness is good, but consider stretching the boxes across the page and placing the *Reserve* button at the bottom.
  - **Tablet**:
    - [checked] Cards in the *Rooms* section appear misaligned.
    - [checked?] The *Reservations* section responsiveness needs adjustment.

### Positive Notes

- All required elements from the prototype are present.
- The *Reservations* section responsiveness for mobile is implemented well.

### Suggestions

Work on the responsiveness issues, especially for mobile and tablet views, before submitting the final version of your site.
